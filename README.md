# A bike sharing company want to expand and the task is to analyze which cities will be best for starting out and the the minimum population strength for rolling out a successful business. What constraints have affected the profits and what will maximize them.

### Linear Regression with NumPy and Python. We will accomplish this with the help of following tasks in the project:

* Task 1: Introduction and Import Libraries
* Task 2: Load the Data and Libraries
* Task 3: Visualize the Data
* Task 4: Compute the Cost 𝐽(𝜃)
* Task 5: Implement Gradient Descent from scratch in Python
* Task 6: Visualizing the Cost Function J(𝜃)
* Task 7: Plotting the Convergence
* Task 8: Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit
* Task 9: Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
